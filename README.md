## Chatbot with Deep Learning

This project implements a simple AI chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot is trained to recognize user inputs and respond with appropriate messages based on predefined intents and patterns.

Features

Trained on a JSON-based dataset containing intents, patterns, and responses.

Uses TensorFlow and Keras to create a Sequential neural network model.

Implements label encoding and tokenization for preprocessing user inputs.

Provides interactive chat functionality with dynamic responses.

Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv chatbot_env
source chatbot_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: chatbot_env\Scripts\activate

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset

The dataset used is stored in the intents.json file. It contains:

intents: Categories or tags of user inputs.

patterns: Example user inputs for each intent.

responses: Possible responses from the bot for each intent.

Code Explanation

1. Training the Model

The chatbot training script processes the intents.json dataset.

User input patterns are tokenized and padded using Keras utilities.

A Sequential model is built with layers:

Embedding: Converts words into dense vectors.

GlobalAveragePooling1D: Reduces the dimensionality of embeddings.

Dense: Fully connected layers for classification.

2. Saving the Model

After training, the model is saved as chat_model.

Tokenizer and label encoder are serialized using pickle.

3. Inference

The chatbot inference script loads the saved model, tokenizer, and label encoder.

User inputs are preprocessed to predict intents and provide appropriate responses.

Running the Project

Train the chatbot:

python chatbot_training.py

Start the chatbot:

python chatbot_inference.py

Chat with the bot! Type your message, and the bot will respond.

Future Improvements

Expand Dataset: Add more intents and patterns to improve bot versatility.

Improve Model: Use more complex architectures for better predictions.

Add Context Awareness: Implement context tracking for multi-turn conversations.

Deploy: Host the chatbot on a web platform or integrate it into messaging apps.
